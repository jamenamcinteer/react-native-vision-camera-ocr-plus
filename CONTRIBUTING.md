# Contributing

Contributions are always welcome, no matter how large or small!

We want this community to be friendly and respectful to each other. Please follow it in all your interactions with the project. Before contributing, please read the [code of conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Development workflow

This project contains two packages:

- The library package in the root directory.
- An example app in the `example/` directory.

To get started, run `yarn` in the root directory to install the library's dependencies, then run `yarn` again inside `example/` to install the example app's dependencies:

```sh
yarn
cd example && yarn
```

> This project uses Yarn. Using [`npm`](https://github.com/npm/cli) is not recommended.

The [example app](/example/) demonstrates usage of the library. You need to run it to test any changes you make.

It is configured to use the local version of the library, so any changes you make to the library's source code will be reflected in the example app. Changes to the library's JavaScript code will be reflected in the example app without a rebuild, but native code changes will require a rebuild of the example app.

To start the example app, first `cd` into the `example` directory:

```sh
cd example
```

Then start the development server:

```sh
yarn start
```

To run the example app on Android:

```sh
yarn android
```

To run the example app on iOS:

```sh
yarn ios
```

The following commands are run from the **root** directory. Make sure your code passes TypeScript and ESLint:

```sh
yarn typecheck
yarn lint
```

To fix formatting errors, run the following:

```sh
yarn lint:fix
```

Remember to add tests for your change if possible. Run the unit tests by:

```sh
yarn test
```

### Commit message convention

We follow the [conventional commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en) for our commit messages:

- `fix`: bug fixes, e.g. fix crash due to deprecated method.
- `feat`: new features, e.g. add new method to the module.
- `refactor`: code refactor, e.g. migrate from class components to hooks.
- `docs`: changes into documentation, e.g. add usage example for the module..
- `test`: adding or updating tests, e.g. add integration tests using detox.
- `chore`: tooling changes, e.g. change CI config.

Our pre-commit hooks verify that your commit message matches this format when committing.

### Linting and tests

[ESLint](https://eslint.org/), [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

We use [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for type checking, [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for linting and formatting the code, and [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for testing.

Our pre-commit hooks verify that the linter and tests pass when committing.

### Scripts

The root `package.json` contains scripts for common tasks:

- `yarn`: setup project by installing dependencies.
- `yarn typecheck`: type-check files with TypeScript.
- `yarn lint`: lint files with ESLint.
- `yarn lint:fix`: lint and auto-fix formatting errors.
- `yarn test`: run unit tests with Jest.

The `example/package.json` contains scripts for running the example app (run these from the `example/` directory):

- `yarn start`: start the Expo development server.
- `yarn android`: run the example app on Android.
- `yarn ios`: run the example app on iOS.

### Sending a pull request

> **Working on your first pull request?** You can learn how from this _free_ series: [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://app.egghead.io/playlists/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

When you're sending a pull request:

- **Target the `next-release` branch** — all pull requests should be opened against `next-release`, not `main`.
- Prefer small pull requests focused on one change.
- Verify that linters and tests are passing.
- Review the documentation to make sure it looks good.
- Follow the pull request template when opening a pull request.
- For pull requests that change the API or implementation, discuss with maintainers first by opening an issue.
- **Address all Copilot review comments** — either make the suggested change or leave a comment explaining why the change is not needed.
